Yet another DHT22 (temperature and humidity sensor) acquisition routine.
This one is for MBED OS.
Interrupt driven, with a simple blocking API.
Written initially for MBED OS 5.
Tested on a Nucleo STM32F446RE 180 MHz.
Quite heavy on interrupts: rising and falling edge are read through an
interrupt for timing, and the DHT 22 communication protocol calls for
a signal every 28 us at worst. The communication between the ISR and
the main code is through an MBED queue, so if you're running it on a
slower MCU, I'm interested to hear from you.
